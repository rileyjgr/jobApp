# jobApp

This is an application you can run on heroku

Once finished you will be able to make post requests to an api, and update your jobs database. 

Later, this will use machine learning to determine which jobs I should apply to, based on outcomes on previous ones.

There will be an anayltics dashboard, to show data on your job application process.
